# I2C_LCD
PCF8574 I2C module for 16x02/04 Display for MPLAB XC8 with MCC ( PIC18F46K22 )

The code is not mine. I'll leave the link to the genius creator.

I took his code and translated it to english since it was all on turkish for the sake of all non turkish speakers <3. All hails gencmucitler. A true genius!

I have not tested all the functions but I guarantee the project included by me works perfectly I tested fisically. No proteus bullshit!

What is included?
Project folder to directly upload on PIC18F46K22 microcontroller using the Curiosity HPC development board.
Separately the libraries to include on MPLAB XC8 to use with any PIC microcontroller with MCC support.

Recomended:
Create new .c/.h in your current project and copy and paste the corresponding codes on the files to avoid any problems with directories withing your MPLAB project.
